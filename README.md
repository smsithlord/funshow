# ALPHA
This is an early version of FunShow & may contain unknown bugs or have missing features. It is functional for my own purposes, but it will evolve as it is adapted for the needs of others & as my own needs from it evolve.

# Developing Changes To The Code
There are `dev_` versions of the following files which will load the SRC scripts instead of the DIST scripts: dev_index.html, dev_builder.html, dev_viewer.html.

# Building New Distribution Files
There is a tool in `src/packer_tool.html` that can be ran from a LOCAL SERVER that lets you BUILD ALL which gives you the following files: funshow-builder.min.js, funshow-shared.min.js, funshow-viewer.min.js.
